### bash scripts to facilitate fuzz testing

    1. fuzz.sh -> download testcase and run binary on it
    2. coverage.sh -> coverage analysis with dynamorio.
    3. kill_timeout.sh -> kill running process alive more than 30 seconds
    4. checksec -> not my script (used to check sec settings on binary)
